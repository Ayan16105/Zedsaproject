                          Born out of a labour of love and a dedication to creative diligence, HOGA Films came into being
                          in Jaipur,2018, with 2021 marking
                          a pivotal year in which we introduced our second office in Bombay. What kickstarted as a small media
                          house with
                          just four members, has since evolved into a dynamaic group of creative minds with a core collective vision.

                          With a foundation built with accredited individual achievements, our founders have worked with
                          acclaimed filmmakers,international films
                          festivals,a documentory feature in Incredible India, platforms such as Netflix, 
                          Amazon, BBC India, along with being invited as a speaker for
                          esteemed brands such as TEDx, Google talks, Columbia and Qatar Foundation. Together, 
                          our goal is to create narratives through cross-cultural
                          storytelling, and breaking boundaries with the universal language of creativity.

                          While documentary films and live events marked our earlier projects, we remained undeterred by the
                          challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, through which we
                          launched a sister concern brand, Lockdown Shorts Studio. The latter was a culmination of films
                          created with the global limitation of not being able to set
                          foot outside our homes an achievement that brought fulfilment on both a human, and creatively
                          humbling level.

                          Along with the challenges of production during the pandemic,securing a platform to show-case our
                          work posed an even bigger challenge. Post ten months
                          of perseverance,the fruits of our labour transpired in the form of a contarct with Disney+Hotstar,
                          our entry into the OTT World which received recognition
                          from leading news agencies. Under the banner of Lockdown Shorts Studio, we have since produced the
                          trending 'Ishq Express'(IMDb rating - 7.7/10) and 'Uljhey Hyue'
                          (IMDb rating 8.1/10) for Amazon's Mini TV. The appreciation we garnered, encouraged us to establish
                          a content bank, beginning with 'PROVIDER' a six-part we series.

                      Our proudest and longest project at HOGA Films is documenting the journey of <a href="https://www.dhun.life/">Dhun</a> ; the
                      500-acre suburban neighbourhood of Jaipur that redefines living development practices
                      to provide freedom, inspiration, and resources. Today, we are thrilled to be handling
                      the project’s complete communication. HOGA Films took the backstage, choreographing
                      the marketing and communication campaign for the Learning Summit in Jaisalmer, brought 
                      together by Roundglass in February 2020. A campaign in which 120 leaders in Education
                      from around the globe came together to develop a framework for learning that promotes 
                      universal well-being. In 2021, driven by a collective need for recovery post the COVID-19 
                      pandemic, HOGA Films had the privilege to run the citizen airline marketing campaign, and 
                      are proud to have been a part of the inspiring initiative that became a lifeline for 
                      Jaisalmer's tourism industry, the "citizen-airline partnership model.” Not only did 
                      this bring back airlines to Jaisalmer, but also revived the tourism industry; a ground
                      breaking campaign that has become a case study today.

                      Our motto is born through the idea that our innate need for storytelling predates 
                      cave paintings! Cue… the introduction to our <a href="https://hogafilms.zedsa.co/eschool.html">HOGA e-school</a>. Our goal with this 
                      platform is to break down the barrier that filmmaking is a privilege for the reserved 
                      few, through making it accessible to everyone through our workshops and practical based learning through exposure.
                      HOGA Films stays dedicated to creating stories that cross boundaries and inspire change. From stitching together
                      a narrative that nurtures the needs of the stories that exist beyond films, to creating powerful campaigns,
                      our commitment to storytelling continues to drive us forward.
